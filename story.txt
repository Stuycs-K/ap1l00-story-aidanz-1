Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money
in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on the shore, I thought I would hurry about
a little and see the <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the
spleen and regulating circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth;
whenever it is a <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE>, <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily
fleeing before coffin bird, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and
especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE>
moral principle to prevent me from deliberately spitting into the street, and methodically
stealing people's hats off—then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can.
There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree,
some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the people with me.
